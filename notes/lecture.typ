== Definition

- Definition: multi-linear algebra
  - Linear: $f(alpha x + beta y) = alpha f(x) + beta f(y)$
  - Multilinear: having multiple linear arguments
  - e.g.1 product: $f(x, y, z) = x y z$
  - e.g.2 trace multiplication of a sequence of matrices: $f(A, B, C) = tr(A B C)$
  - e.g.3 kronecker product: $f(X, Y, Z) = X times.circle Y times.circle Z$
  - e.g.4 Not multilinear: $f(x + y + z) = x + y + z$
